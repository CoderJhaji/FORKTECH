## ❌ Problem
People with dietary restrictions, allergies, or limited ingredient availability struggle to cook authentic dishes.  
Simple ingredient substitutions often ruin taste, texture, and cultural authenticity.

## ✅ Our Solution
**RasSetu** regenerates recipes using AI, flavor science, and cultural rules.  
Instead of suggesting substitutions, it rewrites the entire recipe to match dietary needs while preserving original taste and cooking logic.

👉 Users receive a final, ready-to-cook recipe — not a confusing substitution list.
